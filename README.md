# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 I created this Prework Study Guide so that I could have easy access to helpful notes about the topics we learned throught the three prework modules. I also included some commands which will be helpful to memorize in the future. Hopefully, I can use this study guide to better educate myself about CSS, JavaScript, Git, and HTML so that I am better prepared for the future of this course. Likewise, it could come in handy for other students who need to learn the preceding topics like I have to. 

## Installation

In order to get the Prework Study Guide running properly, I had to follow the modules step-by-step guides as well as look towards the internet to help troubleshoot some of the problems I encountered.

The first step was to set-up the basic HTML aspects of the website using the code that was given to us through the module. We created our first new branch and then entered some basic code into VS Code. Immediately after we extended the code and made our basic framework for what our Prework Study Guide would rest on for the remainder of the project. 

After this step we would push our newest set of code to GitHub using some basic git commands. This would be an important step which we would take after each and every extension of our code.

The second major step was to add our CSS code so that we could choose how the website would look! We created a new document entitled style.css and then entered our code in the style sheet. This code included headers and footers, and even which colors we would be using on our final webpage. We also needed to make sure that the style sheet was interpreted by the HTML document we created before and so we entered some key lines of code in the orifinal document to make sure it would be using our style sheet in the final build of our website. Like before we would push our code to the main branch of our repository and make sure it ended up back on GitHub.

The next step would be adding functionality to our website by adding JavaScript to our code. We would do this by adding the ability to interact with the console of the webpage should one use the inspect tool after finding themselves lucky enough to see our study guide! By creating a script.js document in which we would add some code, we were able to add functionality to our website. This process took a few different steps in which we stepped forwards and backwards a couple different times, but in the end we were able to make several different tabs which correlated with the topics our study guide goes over. Throughout this process we pushed and pulled our code to the GitHub repository and were able to see realtime results through our web browser.

One of our final steps was to add create this README document so that our study guide would have real insight from each of us into how we were able to get to the final result; a functioning webpage. 

Personally, I ran into a couple difficulties which all stemmed from one key issue. When I originally placed a folder titled "prework-study-guide" into an already existing file entitled "prework-study-guide," I had to change the formers name to "prework-study-guide1" and so many of my pull requests were out of sorts due to the confusing nameing hierachy I created. Ultimately when it came time to publish the website using GitHub, it seemed to only display my README document instead of using the index.html file in which my central code was located. After digging and finding some very helpful web-pages, I was able to deduce that all my assets should be moved out of the folder that they were in and placed with both the index.html file and the README.md file. Thankfully, this simple solution worked and my prework study guide is now successfully live!



## Usage

You are able to use this prework study guide however you need to study one of the four topics which we learned about throughout our prework. You can use the website interactivity by right clicking anywhere on the webpage and selecting inspect (it's at the bottom!). You can then navigate to the "console" section and choose any of the topics which are shown in the aforementioned list!

# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

I had to go through several steps to make this prework study guide webpage. These included coding the html, css and JavaScript ascpects of the webpage so it would appear correctly and run to the instructors liking. I also had to push and pull all my code to GitHub so that I could publish the webpage succesfully.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
